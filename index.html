        <p class="introduction">Hello everyone, my name is Victor Flores. I served my mission in the Philippine Iloilo Mission from 2018 to 2020. 
            I really enjoyed serving in the Philippines because some of my family is from the Philippines on an island that is nearby where I served. 
            I got to learn a lot about the culture and some history of the country and grow closer to the roots of part of my family. 
            I currently live in southern California and have lived here for most of my life. 
            I am the oldest of 4 children and I like working on computers and playing games.
            I have built a few computers for myself and for my friends and family.
